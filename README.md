## Quick start

To get started, you will need a raspberry pi 3b that will serve as your controller, and a second raspberry pi 3b mounted on Rover. You will want a desktop img on your controller and a CLI on Rover.

-  [Clone this repo](https://github.com/seb3n/Rover.git) and run the respective install script on both the controller and Rover.

- If installing this on a new machine, make sure the machine has python3 at the latest verion.


- activate i2c using sudo raspi-config command => peripherals

- your root folder should look like the following on the rover: /home/pi/development/Rover/

- When testing the install, make sure it is done on the rover, as you will get an error from not having any sensors connected.

- Once tested without openCV, you can install opencv on a pytho-env 

## What's included

* OpenCV tracking.
* Forward distance measurement.
* Claw manupulation.
* Motion using tank tracks.

## Controller setup

Once the Repo is cloned on your device, you should be able to run 

``` 
$ python3 /home/pi/Rover/Controller/RaspTankTest.py
``` 
<br> This should display a GUI on your controller.

Now lets install OpenCV and other dependencies so that we can receive the camera stream from Rover.

on your controller, run the following commands:
```
$ cd
$ cd Rover/Controller
$ sudo python3 controller_setup.py
```


## Rover setup

run the install script
